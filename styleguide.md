The Kandoo app uses a large and diverse color palette of eight colors, plus gray and white. Main colors are gray, blue-green, dark blue, and white, with the others serving as various alert and accent colors. 

These were chosen to appear calm and business-like and to encourage productive thinking, and to have the appropriate visual contrast.

## Modules

Each module of the app has been thoughtfully designed and styled to provide users with a seamless experience and a cohesive visual identity. 

### Home Page
Upon arriving at the home page, users see a streamlined and focused login page emphasizing our slogan of "Projects. Together." The intentional simplicity of the design ensures that users are immediately directed towards the login process, emphasizing a straightforward and efficient onboarding experience.

### KanBan Boards
KanBan boards are designed using the app's signature teal and white. The design here is meant to encourage ease of use and make it easy for the user to input and modify their task lists. 

### Accessibility

The Kandoo planner app is committed to accessibility, incorporating features to ensure an inclusive experience for all users. This includes the provision of alternative text (alt text) for images, enabling screen readers to convey information to visually impaired users accurately. Our design decisions adhere to accessibility standards, promoting equal access and usability for everyone.

### Typography 
The Kandoo app employs a clean and easily readable typeface to enhance user comfort and facilitate quick comprehension of information. The chosen typeface ensures legibility across various device sizes and screen resolutions, contributing to a seamless user experience.

### Buttons and Interactive Elements
Interactive elements, such as buttons, follow a consistent design language throughout the app. They are designed to be visually distinct, with clear hover and active states, ensuring users are aware of their interactions. The color palette is intentionally used to convey the appropriate context, such as primary actions, secondary actions, and alerts.

### Icons

Icons within the app are selected for their clarity and relevance. They enhance the user experience by providing visual cues that aid in navigation and understanding. The design approach ensures that icons are universally recognizable and contribute to the overall cohesive visual identity of the app.
